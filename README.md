# TensorFlow2-for-Deep-Learning
Scripts for the TensorFlow2 for Deep Learning courses

All scripts here are from the course [TensorFlow2-for-Deep-Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow2-deeplearning)

This repository was built just to have a place to save my work in the specialization. All info here is property of the [TensorFlow2-for-Deep-Learning specialization.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow2-deeplearning)

Course 1: [Getting Started with Tensorflow 2.0](https://github.com/DiegoCorona/TensorFlow2-for-Deep-Learning/tree/main/Course_1%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Tensorflow%202.0)

Course 2: [Customising your models with Tensorflow 2.0](https://github.com/DiegoCorona/TensorFlow2-for-Deep-Learning/tree/main/Course_2%20Customising%20your%20models%20with%20TensorFlow%202.0)
- Extra for week 2: [Keras_TimeseriesGenerator](https://github.com/DiegoCorona/TensorFlow2-for-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Week2_Keras_TimeseriesGenerator.ipynb)
